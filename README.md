# FED Technical Test

Welcome to the UI/UX Guild's Frontend Developer Techincal Test!

There are no right or wrong answers (there's always many ways to tackle the same problem!), but we do ask you describe your thinking process as you complete each part of this test.

You are welcome to use external resources as needed. Please show what resources you use.

You will have 45 minutes to complete this test. If you get stuck on a particular task, don't worry ‚Äì you are welcome to continue with other tasks and come back to it after. If you cannot complete a task, that's okay.

## Tasks

### Task 1 ‚Äì Get setup!

We use [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage this application's dependencies.

Run [NPM's install command](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-install) to install the required dependencies.

Start the server.

Hint: Opening the Console in Google Chrome's Dev Tools can provide useful information.

### Task 2 ‚Äì Welcome!

In the application, it currently says "Welcome, Jessica"

The user should be able to enter their name into the input box and have the welcome message automatically update.

For example, if the user were to enter their name "Bob", this should read "Welcome, Bob"

### Task 3 ‚Äì Favourite Colour

Bob's favourite colour is Orange (#ff6b00).

Jessica's favourite colour is Blue (#00abff).

Set the text colour of the user's name to their favourite colour.

### Task 4 ‚Äì Let's be Friends!

Bob has 3 friends:
  * Brian
  * Valene
  * Juli

Jessica has 5 friends:
  * Nelson
  * Juli
  * Marivel
  * Tomeka
  * Russ

Using the name provided by the user, update the Friends List to display a list of their friends' names. These names should be in the order as provided above.

If we don't have the user's friends list, instead show a message "We couldn't find your friends list" (or similar).

### Task 5 ‚Äì Besties for Life!

We want to show some extra love to our best friends!

Bob's best friend is Valene.

Jessica's best friend is Juli.

On the Friends List, show a "üíñ" next to the user's best friend. How cute!

### Task 6 ‚Äì Smile!

Show the user's friends' profile picture alongside their name.
